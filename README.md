I study on Software Engineering at İstinye University. 
I want to create so I can learn. I still have so much missing piece but I believe it will cover itself by working.
I made a little project that you can register people to database and you can make updates person informations on it.( Used windows form c# and sql)
Lately I'm working on a web project.
I love design the program and communicate with people about what they want.
