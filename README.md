I study on Software Engineering at Ä°stinye Univercity, I have 2 free day in a week. 
I want to create so I can learn. I still have so much missing piece but I believe it will cover itself by working.
I made a some tkinter interface. (Python)
I made a little project that you can register people to database and you can make updates person informations on it.( Used windows form c# and sql)
I love design the program and communicate with people about what they want.
